    answer                                : "Yes. There might be security warnings as we don't distribute the app via official app stores. That allows us to incorporate feedback much faster at a low cost. If this is a strong reason not to use the application, please write us at <a href = \"mailto: guassistant@icloud.com\">guassistant@icloud.com</a>."

  - title                                 : Does Gods Unchained see this as cheating?
    answer                                : "There have been similar applications before where the team did not see this violating existing policies. Find a related conversation on GU Discord <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/457152051239976961/475481117244391424/1073930374213799967\">here</a>."

  - title                                 : Isn't this hacking?
